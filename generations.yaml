    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Ampera was the European variant of the Chevrolet Volt, representing General Motors' first extended-range electric vehicle (E-REV) or series plug-in hybrid. Featuring distinctive, futuristic styling with a unique front fascia, aerodynamic profile, and special lighting elements that differentiated it from conventional Vauxhall/Opel models, the Ampera was designed to showcase GM's advanced electric propulsion technology. Powered by a 16 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and an electric motor producing 149 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, the Ampera could travel approximately 25-50 miles on electricity alone depending on conditions. Once the battery reached a predetermined depletion level, a 1.4-liter gasoline engine functioned primarily as a generator to produce electricity for the motor, extending the total range to around 300 miles. This powertrain architecture differed from traditional hybrids by using the electric motor for propulsion in almost all driving scenarios, with the gasoline engine rarely providing direct mechanical drive to the wheels. The interior featured a futuristic design with two 7-inch displays providing comprehensive information about the powertrain's operation, energy flow, and efficiency metrics, alongside practical features including seating for four passengers (with the battery tunnel limiting the vehicle to four seats) and a reasonable 300-liter luggage capacity. The Ampera won numerous accolades including European Car of the Year 2012, but faced challenges in the European market due to its relatively high price compared to conventional alternatives. Despite its technical sophistication and favorable reviews, sales remained modest, and the model was discontinued in 2015 without a direct replacement as GM reconsidered its European product strategy, ultimately leading to the sale of Vauxhall/Opel to PSA Group in 2017."

    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Ampera-e represented a complete reconceptualization of the Ampera nameplate, abandoning the extended-range hybrid approach of its predecessor in favor of a pure battery-electric vehicle based on the North American Chevrolet Bolt EV. A compact five-door hatchback with crossover-inspired styling elements, the Ampera-e featured a more conventional exterior design than its predecessor but with distinctive elements including a blanked-off grille, unique light signatures, and aerodynamic optimizations appropriate for an electric vehicle. Powered by a 60 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and a single electric motor producing 204 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque driving the front wheels, the Ampera-e delivered impressive performance with 0-62 mph acceleration in 7.3 seconds alongside a WLTP-rated range of approximately 240 miles—class-leading for its time and price point. DC fast charging capability allowed for approximately 90 miles of range to be added in 30 minutes under ideal conditions. The interior emphasized technology and space efficiency, featuring a 10.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, and surprisingly generous passenger and cargo accommodation considering the vehicle's compact exterior dimensions—a benefit of the purpose-built electric architecture with the battery positioned under the floor. Despite its technical merits and positive reception, the Ampera-e faced a challenging existence in Europe. Shortly after its introduction, General Motors announced the sale of Vauxhall/Opel to PSA Group, creating uncertainty about the model's future. Limited supply and allocation issues further complicated its market presence, and production for European markets ended in 2019 as the new PSA ownership focused on developing electric vehicles based on their own platforms rather than continuing with GM-derived products. The Ampera-e thus had a brief but significant tenure as Opel/Vauxhall's first mainstream pure electric vehicle, demonstrating the capabilities of battery-electric technology before the brand's more comprehensive electrification strategy under Stellantis ownership."
